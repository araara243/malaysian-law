# Malaysian Legal RAG System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for Malaysian statutory law. This system provides AI-powered legal question answering with citation support, built on ChromaDB for vector storage and Google Gemini for language generation.

## Overview

This project implements a complete RAG pipeline for querying Malaysian legal statutes. The system uses hybrid retrieval (combining semantic similarity and keyword matching) to find relevant legal provisions, then generates natural language answers with proper citations.

### Supported Legal Acts

| Category | Act | Act Number | Year |
|----------|-----|------------|------|
| **Commercial** | Contracts Act | Act 136 | 1950 |
| **Commercial** | Specific Relief Act | Act 137 | 1951 |
| **Commercial** | Partnership Act | Act 135 | 1961 |
| **Commercial** | Sale of Goods Act | Act 383 | 1957 |
| **Property** | Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act | Act 118 | 1966 |
| **Property** | Strata Titles Act | Act 318 | 1985 |
| **Civil Procedure** | Courts of Judicature Act | Act 91 | 1964 |

### Performance Metrics

Based on evaluation against a 36-question golden dataset across 7 Acts:

| Category | Questions | Hit Rate @ 1 | Hit Rate @ 3 | MRR |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Commercial | 20 | 95.0% | 100.0% | 0.975 |
| Property | 8 | 87.5% | 100.0% | 0.938 |
| Civil Procedure | 4 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 1.000 |
| **Overall** | **32** | **94.5%** | **100.0%** | **0.969** |

### Category-Based Evaluation

To evaluate performance per legal category:

```bash
python src/evaluation/evaluate_rag.py --categories --dataset tests/golden_dataset_expanded.json
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager
- Google API key for Gemini access

### Setup Steps

1. **Create and activate virtual environment**

   ```bash
   cd MyLaw-RAG
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   Copy the example environment file and add your API key:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and set:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   To obtain a Google API key, visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## Usage

### Running the Web Interface

```bash
streamlit run src/app/app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Example Queries

- "What are the requirements for specific performance of a contract?"
- "When is a contract voidable due to coercion?"
- "What are the licensing requirements for housing developers?"

---

## Data Pipeline

The data ingestion pipeline consists of four stages. These only need to be run if rebuilding the database from scratch.

### Stage 1: PDF Download

Downloads legal act PDFs from the Attorney General's Chambers (AGC) website.

```bash
python src/ingestion/agc_scraper.py
```

Output: PDF files in `data/raw/`

### Stage 2: Text Extraction

Extracts and cleans text from PDFs, removing headers, footers, and watermarks.

```bash
python src/ingestion/text_extractor.py
```

Output: JSON files in `data/processed/` containing raw and cleaned text.

### Stage 3: Semantic Chunking

Splits documents into chunks by legal section boundaries rather than arbitrary token limits.

```bash
python src/ingestion/chunker.py
```

Output: `*_chunks.json` files in `data/processed/` containing chunked text with metadata.

### Stage 4: Vector Database Ingestion

Generates embeddings and stores chunks in ChromaDB.

```bash
python src/ingestion/vector_ingest.py
```

Output: ChromaDB collection in `data/vector_db/`

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/test_rag.py -v
```

Test coverage includes:
- AGC scraper URL construction
- Text extraction and cleaning
- Section detection in chunker
- Hybrid retriever functionality
- Golden dataset retrieval accuracy

### Retrieval Evaluation

Run the evaluation script to compute Hit Rate and MRR metrics:

```bash
python src/evaluation/evaluate_rag.py
```

Results are saved to `tests/evaluation_results.json`.

---

## Configuration

The project uses a centralized configuration file at `src/config.py`. You can modify the `RAGConfig` dataclass to adjust parameters such as:

- **Chunking**: `chunk_size`, `chunk_overlap`
- **Retrieval**: `top_k`, `semantic_weight`, `keyword_weight`, `rrf_k`
- **Models**: `embedding_model`, `llm_model`, `temperature`
- **Vector DB**: `collection_name`

Environment variables are managed via `.env` file (see `.env.example`).

---

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure you:
- Add type hints to new functions.
- Add docstrings obeying Google style.
- Run tests before submitting.

## Limitations

1. **Scope**: Currently supports 7 Malaysian Acts across commercial, property, and civil procedure law. Expansion to other domains (criminal law, family law) requires additional PDF sources and re-ingestion.

2. **Currency**: Legal texts are static snapshots. Updates to legislation require manual re-ingestion.

3. **Not Legal Advice**: This system provides information retrieval and AI-generated summaries. It is not a substitute for professional legal counsel.

4. **API Dependency**: LLM generation requires an active Google API key with available quota. The system falls back to displaying raw retrieved sections when the API is unavailable.

5. **Category Coverage**: While commercial and property law are well-represented, other legal domains have limited or no coverage.
